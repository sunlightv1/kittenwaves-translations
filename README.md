#### Don't know how to make a pull request or you're unsure of something? Feel free to DM @vx.aboveground on Discord!

## What will I get in return?
- Complete or nearly complete translations will earn you:
  - A free KittenWaves license key
  - A Translator role in the [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/PKbutPa4wQ)

## Notes
- Please only contribute translations if you're fluent or a native speaker of the language — we want accurate, natural phrasing, not machine-translated text
- You’re not required to maintain your translations — they're public so anyone can contribute or improve them
- Translations are pulled manually — they'll only be included when I make a new release
- Only the English file is updated directly
- Missing translations will automatically fall back to English
